This kojo is my first work related to eratoho the world.
Given that no any kojo of Shizuha is written, I take the job and complete it in three and a half month.
You'd better play it in a version over 4.940.
To load it in the game, put the file"你好，秋姑娘" into path:"\ERB\口上・メッセージ関連\個人口上\077 Shizuha [静葉]" and delete "HOGE".
Shizuha is a girl who seem to have little popularity in Touhou, and has a little sister called Minoriko,and both of them are Gods of Autumn in Gensyoko. So this kojo includes my impression, imagination, compassion, passion and affection for her.
Wish you'd have a great Autumn!
