Resource management patch by EvilMask: https://gitgud.io/EvilMask/eratw_rmpatch

Significantly reduces memory consumption from ~900mb idle to 1.5gb with most resources loaded, by loading necessary images when needed instead of loading them all at the start.
The .xml files contain sprite information instead of .csv files. Use the included python script to keep xml files up to date (rename txt to csv first, needs python 3.9+)
This feature requires EE Emuera.

@RM_タイトル画像用意
This function loads and create title sprites
@SYSTEM_LOADEND
This one releases them after loading a save
@RM_リソース情報初期化
This one loads sprite information from .xml files and stores them into a map
@RM_リソースチェック(リソース名)
This one is an alternative to SPRITECREATED, returns 1 if リソース名 is a created sprite on the screen or in the map.
@RM_リソースチェック_ロード(リソース名)
Similar to @RM_リソースチェック(リソース名) but also loads the image and creates the sprite before returning 1
@RM_全部リリース
Release all loaded images, purging image cache
